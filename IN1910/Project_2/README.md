# Get element i by index
Arraylist O(1) < Linkedlist O(n) \
To get an element i in arraylist is going to cost less than linkedlist\
The linkedlist has to go through the link until it finds the ith element\
# Insert at front 
LinkedList O(1) < Arraylist O(n)\
Linkedlist cost less than arraylist. Linkedlist starts at the first element.\
Adding one element to arraylist changes all the positions of all elements in the list.\
# Insert at back
Arraylist O(1) < Linkedlist O(n) \	
Linkedlist has to loop through every element.\
# Insert into middle
LinkedList O(n) = Arraylist O(n)\
Linkedlist loops through and needs to insert and \
change one element to point to the new one instead ot the old one.\
Arraylist needs to change the index of every element going through the whole list\
# Remove element from front
LinkedList O(1) < Arraylist O(n)\
Arraylist changes indexes of every element\
# Remove element from back.
Arraylist O(n) <  Linkedlist O(n)\
Linked list need to loop through the list to get to the back\
# Remove element from middle
LinkedList O(n) = Arraylist O(n)\
Array list needs to change index of half the list. Linked list needs to loop through half the list\
# Print
Arraylist O(n) = Linkedlist O(n)\
Arraylist does have the elements more easily available and uses less memory\
