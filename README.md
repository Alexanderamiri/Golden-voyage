### Golden-voyage
Code I've written for different courses during my physics/astrophysics, robotics or math bachelor's degrees. These programs are mostly of some decent size as I have chosen not to upload smaller scripts that span just a couple of lines with no functions or solution to a complex problem.\
Towards the third year I started using more classes and functions as well as document code.
