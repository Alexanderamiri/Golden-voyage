## AST3310 â€“ Astrophysical Plasma and Stellar Interiors

### This course was focused on our sun and how to make a model of our sun or any other star. We achived this by doing numerical integrations of the governing laws of physics that act within the sun. This course was numerically dense

Three important areas
- Numerical analysis, Error propagation and stability 
- Nuclear reactions
- Writing scientific reports

Project 1: Simulation a stars core and it's energy output\
Project 2: Simulating convection and radiation transport\
Project 3: Numerical analysis of stability and animation of complete star model
