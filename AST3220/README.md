### Cosmology is about the history of the universe. The course gives knowledge of different universe models, how the universe has expanded and an overview of different theories about what dark energy and dark matter is

Three important areas
- Describing spacetime
- Numerical analysis of different theories compared to real data
- Writing scientific reports

Project 1: Modeling a universe with an extra dimension
Project 2: Modeling a universe with weakly interactive massive particles (WIMPs)
Project 3: Slow-roll approximation
